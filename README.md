### Student Stress Factors - Classification Analysis
This project is part of the work completed during my first term in the AI & ML program at Lambton College. The focus is on performing a classification analysis on the Student Stress Factors dataset from Kaggle.

#### Overview
The Student Stress Factors dataset contains information about various factors contributing to student stress. The primary goal is to predict the level of stress among students based on these factors.

#### Objectives
Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
Build and evaluate classification models to predict stress levels.
Interpret the results and identify key factors influencing student stress.

#### Classification Problem
The primary task is to predict the stress level of students (Stress_Level: Low, Moderate, High) using the available features. This involves:

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing data.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- Identifying potential correlations between features.

#### Model Building:
- Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

#### Model Evaluation:
-Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- Comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.

#### Interpretation and Insights:
- Analyzing feature importances.
- Drawing conclusions about the key factors affecting student stress levels.

#### Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing classification models and evaluation metrics.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
